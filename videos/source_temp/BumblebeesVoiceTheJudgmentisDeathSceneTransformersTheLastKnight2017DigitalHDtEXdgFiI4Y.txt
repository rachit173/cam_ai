Prime!
Stop!
No!
I
am
Bumblebee,
your
oldest
friend.
Optimus,
I
would
lay
down
my
life
for
you.
Bumblebee.
Your
voice.
I
have
not
heard
it
since
cybertron
fell.
What
have
I
done?
You
blew
your
chance
to
kill
unicron.
I
knew
you
couldn't
do
it.
Your
time
is
over,
prime.
You
failed.
You
turned
your
back
on
cybertron.
Now
you
will
watch
earth
die.
No!
Not
going
so
well.
Cade!
You
betrayed
your
own
kind.
No,
prime,
get
up!
You
chose
the
wrong
side.
The
guardian
knights
are
going
to
kill
me.
Quintessa
is
the
great
deceiver!
The
judgment
is
death.
Cade,
I
have
failed
you.
I
have
doomed
earth.
Earth,
the
only
place
in
the
universe
whose
people
let
me
call
it
home.
Only
you
can
make
it
right,
prime.
I
can't
do
it
without
you.
One
moment,
that's
all
we
got.
It's
up
to
you,
prime.
Because
without
you,
we
all
die.
It's
now
or
never.
My
brothers,
I
will
never
betray
you
again.
I
am
optimus
prime.
To
save
earth,
we
must
go
to
cybertron
and
destroy
quintessa.
