was
he
married
no
there
was
a
cellist
I
think
sorry
she
looking
good
man
you
an
idiot
why
for
believing
for
taking
on
Loki
alone
he
was
doing
his
job
he
was
I
believe
should
have
waited
you
should
have
sometimes
there
isn't
a
way
out
Tony
right
I
forgot
before
this
is
the
first
time
you
lost
a
soldier
we
are
not
soldiers
I'm
not
Martin
and
Fury's
fight
neither
mine
he's
got
the
same
blood
on
his
hand
that
Loki
does
but
right
now
we
got
to
put
that
behind
us
and
get
this
done
now
Loki
needs
a
power
source
if
we
could
put
together
a
legend
at
a
personal
that's
not
the
point
that
is
the
point
that's
Loki's
point
he
hit
us
all
right
where
we
live
why
stairs
apart
Antonine
conquers
great
but
he
knows
he
has
to
take
us
out
to
win
right
that's
what
it
was
to
beat
us
he
wants
to
be
seen
doing
it
so
what's
the
audience
Troy
right
I
cut
his
act
understood
guy
yeah
that's
just
previous
this
is
this
is
opening
night
and
Loki
he's
a
full-tilt
diva
what
flowers
what's
parades
monument
built
to
the
skies
with
his
name
quest
son
bitch
