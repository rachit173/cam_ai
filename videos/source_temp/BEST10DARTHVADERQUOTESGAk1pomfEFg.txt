if
you
only
knew
the
power
of
the
dark
side
obi-wan
never
told
you
what
happened
the
father
he
told
me
he
told
me
you
killed
no
I
am
the
father
the
son
of
Skywalker
must
not
become
a
Jedi
if
he
could
be
turned
he
would
become
a
powerful
ally
getting
me
done
he
will
join
us
or
die
Master
this
station
is
now
the
ultimate
power
in
the
universe
I
suggest
we
use
it
don't
be
too
proud
of
this
technological
terror
you've
constructed
the
ability
to
destroy
a
planet
is
insignificant
next
to
the
power
of
the
force
you
don't
know
the
power
of
the
dark
side
I
must
obey
my
master
I
will
not
turn
and
you'll
be
forced
to
kill
me
if
that
is
your
destiny
your
sad
devotion
to
that
ancient
religion
has
not
helped
you
conjure
up
the
stolen
data
tapes
or
given
you
clairvoyance
enough
to
find
the
rebels
hidden
fort
I
find
your
lack
of
faith
disturbing
you
are
unwise
to
know
your
defenses
you
have
failed
me
for
the
last
time
captain
Piett
yes
ma'am
make
ready
to
land
our
troops
beyond
their
energy
field
and
deploy
the
feet
so
the
nothing
gets
off
the
system
you
are
in
the
math
now
Admiral
yet
I
can
only
I've
been
waiting
for
you
we
meet
again
at
last
the
circle
is
nothing
when
I
left
you
I
was
but
to
learn
now
I
am
the
master
only
a
master
of
evil
nada
[Music]
obi-wan
is
talking
whether
you
have
controlled
your
fear
now
release
your
anger
only
your
hatred
you
can
destroy
me
you
can
destroy
the
Emperor
he
has
four
scenes
it
is
your
destiny
join
me
and
together
we
can
rule
the
galaxy
as
father
and
son
