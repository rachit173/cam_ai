I
see
you
have
found
a
sacred
peach
tree
of
Evan
Lewis
de
Meaux
is
that
what
this
is
I
am
so
sorry
I
gotta
whiz
like
a
regular
people
tree
I
understand
you
eat
when
you
are
upset
Oh
sir
I'm
not
upset
why
don't
worry
I
will
miss
Ethan
Gaza
so
why
are
you
upset
ah
I
probably
sucked
more
today
than
anyone
in
the
history
of
kung-fu
in
the
history
of
China
in
the
history
of
sucking
probably
and
the
five
man
you
should
have
seen
him
they
totally
hate
me
totally
how
is
she
forever
gonna
turn
me
into
the
Dragon
Warrior
I
mean
I'm
not
like
the
five
I've
got
no
claws
no
wings
no
venom
even
mantis
has
those
thingies
ah
maybe
I
should
just
quit
and
go
back
to
making
noodles
quit
don't
quit
noodles
don't
noodles
you
are
too
concerned
with
what
was
and
what
will
be
is
a
saying
yesterday
is
history
tomorrow
is
a
mystery
but
today
is
a
gift
that
is
why
it
is
called
present
