get
it
out
now
so
certain
are
you
always
with
you
it
cannot
be
done
you
nothing
that
I
say
master
moving
stones
around
is
one
thing
this
is
totally
different
no
no
different
only
different
in
your
mind
you
must
unlearn
what
you
have
there
all
right
I'll
give
it
a
try
No
why
not
do
I'll
do

there
is
no
try
I
can't
it's
too
big
sighs

at
me
let
me

my
Ally

the
force
and
Nepal

it
makes
it
grow
its
energy
surrounds
us
and
binds

must
feel
the
force
around
you

treat
you
me
free
blood
everywhere
yes
even
between
the
ship
you
weren't
impossible
