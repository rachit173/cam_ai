the
only
one
who
can

no
sense
of
humor

a
real
warrior
never
quits

on
how
am
I
supposed
to
beat
Tai
Lung
I
can't
even
beat
you
to
the
stairs
you
will
beat
him
because
you
are
the
Dragon
Warrior
ow
you
don't
believe
that
oh
you
never
believed
that
from
the
first
moment
I
got
here
you've
been
trying
to
get
rid
of
me
yeah
I
was
but
now
I
asked
you
to
trust
in
your
master
as
I
have
come
to
trust
in
mine
you're
not
my
master
and
I'm
not
the
Dragon
Warrior
then
why
didn't
you
quit
you
know
I
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
you
yet
you
stayed
yeah
I
stayed
I
stayed
because
every
time
you
threw
a
brick
at
my
head
or
said
I
smelled
it
hurts
but
it
could
never
hurt
more
than
it
did
every
day
of
my
life
just
being
me
I
stayed
because
I
thought
if
anyone
could
change
me
could
make
me
not
me
it
was
you
the
greatest
kung
fu
teacher
in
all
of
China
but
I
can't
change
you
I
can
turn
you
into
the
Dragon
Warrior
and
I
will
come
on
Tai
Lung
is
on
his
way
here
right
now
and
even
if
it
takes
him
a
hundred
years
to
get
here
how
are
you
gonna
change
this
into
the
Dragon
Warrior
huh
how
how
how
I
don't
know
I
don't
know
that's
what
I
thought
