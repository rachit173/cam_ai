4
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm sorry that was odd

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Thank You Thor you helped create this

6
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,420
I've had a vision a whirlpool that sucks

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,080
in all hope of life and how did Santa is

8
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,550
that what did yep the mind stone it's

9
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,660
one of the six Infinity stones the

10
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,150
greatest power in the universe

11
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,930
unparalleled in its destructive

12
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,720
capabilities then why would you bring

13
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,380
stock is right oh it's definitely the

14
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,360
end times

15
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,120
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron not

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,410
alone why does your vision sound like

17
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,869
Jarvis we reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

18
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,270
to create something new I think I've had

19
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:50,599
my fill of new you think I'm a child of

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:57,220
Ultron you're not I'm not altering I'm

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,220
not Java silent I am

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,680
I looked in your head and saw

23
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,900
annihilation look again her silver

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,790
approval means Jack to me their powers

25
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:09,679
the horrors in our heads Ultron himself

26
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,059
they all came from the mind stone and

27
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,179
nothing compared to what it can unleash

28
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:21,800
the with it on our Tsar is it are you on

29
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:25,180
our side I don't think it's that simple

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:30,380
well better get real simple real soon I

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:33,010
am on the side of life Ultron isn't he

32
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,280
will end it all what's he waiting for

33
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,040
you

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:43,000
where sokovia he's gotten out there too

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,280
if we're wrong about you

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,350
if you're the monster that Ultron major

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,350
to be what what do you do

38
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:03,360
I don't want to kill hadron he's unique

39
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:06,530
and he's in pain but that pain will roll

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,540
over the earth so he must be destroyed

41
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,730
every form he's built every trace of his

42
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,020
presence on the net we have to act now

43
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:21,510
and not one of us can do it without the

44
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:24,990
others maybe I am a monster I don't

45
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:29,030
think I'd know if I were one and not

46
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:31,410
what you are and not what you intended

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,150
so there may be no way to make you trust

48
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,150
me but we need to go

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,820
right well done

50
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,890
three minutes yeah what you need

51
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,890
