what
am
i
you're
my
son
what
more
not
I
am
Loki
of
Asgard
and
I
am
burdened
with
glorious
purpose
no
peace
brother
of
Thor
we
have
no
quarrel
with
your
people
an
ant
has
no
quarrel
with
a
boot
so
you
know
one
who
showed
us
the
way
into
Asgard
has
it's
a
bit
of
fun
raining
to
ruin
my
brother's
big
day
and
to
protect
the
realm
from
his
idiotic
rule
for
a
while
longer
if
I
had
not
taken
you
in
you
would
not
be
here
now
to
hate
me
if
I'm
free
asking
for
mercy
stay
just
swing
it
it's
not
that
I
don't
love
our
little
talks
it's
just
I
don't
love
him
you
know
it
all
makes
sense
now
why
you
favorite
for
all
these
years
because
of
my
how
much
you
claim
to
love
me
even
an
hour
of
frost
giants
enable
the
throne
of
Asgard
[Music]
it's
the
unspoken
truth
of
humanity
that
you
crave
subjugation
you
were
made
to
be
ruled
in
the
end
you
will
always
kneel
loki
is
it
breezy
everyone
was
doing
are
you
mad
possibly
-
okay
[Music]
what
happened
he
want
to
tell
you
so
salt
don't
tell
me
what
I
want
what
maybe
the
ribbon
is
here
I'll
pay
her
a
minute
myself
to
have
the
tesseract
have
power
unlimited
and
for
what
a
warm
lifelong
and
kind
of
share
and
then
to
be
reminded
what
real
power
is
