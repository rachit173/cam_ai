want
to
know
why
lucky
let
us
take
him
he's
not
leading
an
army
from
here
I
don't
think
we
should
be
focusing
on
love
that
guy's
brain
is
a
bag
full
of
cats
he
could
smell
crazy
on
him
I've
care
how
you
speak
loki's
beyond
reason
but
he's
about
God
and
he's
my
brother
he
killed
people
in
two
days
he
doctored
[Applause]
[Music]
you're
no
match
for
the
mighty
not
meant
for
mortal

trying
to

the
girl
tried
to
walk
my
mind
take
special
care
I
got
a
human
to
keep
her
faith
fortunately
I
am
mighty
why
don't
each
other
I
accepted
Astoria
to
kill
our
friends
to
kill
me
why
must
have
been
forcing

Larkin
I'm
a
talented
liar
brother
always
help
me
it's
good
to
have
you
back
lucky
turn
off
the
cataract
or
I'll
destroy
you
can't
there
is
no
stopping
it
there
is
only
the
war
so
be
it
I
will
protect
our
garden
all
the
realms
with
my
last
every
breath
but
I
cannot
do
so
from
that
chair
Loki
for
his
grave
imbalance
understood
rulers
I
know
I
never
will
the
brutality
the
sacrifice
it
changes
you
I'd
rather
be
a
good
man
than
a
great
king
I
turned
that
key
and
drop
this
rock
a
little
early
and
it's
still
billions
dead
how
many
you
can't
stop
that
I
am
Thor
son
of
owned
as
long
as
there
is
life
in
my
breasts
I
am
running
out
of
things
to
say
are
you
ready
