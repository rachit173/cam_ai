1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,780
If it's any comfort,

2
00:00:02,777 --> 00:00:04,677
they died in their sleep.

3
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:14,817
Did you really think
I wanted more of you?

4
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,692
What the hell?

5
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,274
I'm grateful to them, though.

6
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:22,902
They brought you here.

7
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:29,098
Please, Captain.

8
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,975
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand

9
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:33,722
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.

10
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,685
I'm betting I could beat that.

11
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,885
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.

12
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,837
Given time.

13
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,729
But then you'd never know
why you came.

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,593
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?

15
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:55,022
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.

16
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,438
I studied you.

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,360
I followed you.

18
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:01,544
But now that you're standing here...

19
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:03,944
I just realised...

20
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,615
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

21
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,497
How nice to find a flaw.

22
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,671
You're Sokovian.

23
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:18,104
Is that what this is about?

24
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:21,732
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.

25
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:23,261
No.

26
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:27,552
I'm here because I made a promise.

27
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,975
You lost someone?

28
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,893
I lost everyone.

29
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,322
And so will you.

30
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:51,245
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.

31
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,458
But one which crumbles from within?

32
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,582
That's dead.

33
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,709
Forever.

34
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,182
I know that road.

35
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:13,556
What is this?

36
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,461
Help my wife.

37
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:41,873
Please. Help.

38
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,556
Sergeant Barnes?

39
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:51,642
Howard!

40
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:00,268
Howard!

41
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,273
No, Tony.

42
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,654
Did you know?

43
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,176
I didn't know it was him.

44
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:56,364
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

45
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,607
Yes.
