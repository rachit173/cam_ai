performing
I
said
is
not
this
simpler
is
this
not
your
natural
state
it's
the
unspoken
truth
of
humanity
that
you
crave
subjugation
the
bright
lure
of
freedom
diminishes
your
life's
joy
in
a
mad
scramble
for
power
her
identity
you
were
made
to
be
ruled
in
the
end
you
will
always
kneel
not
to
men
like
you
there
are
no
men
like
me
there
are
always
men
like
you
you
