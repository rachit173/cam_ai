there's
not
many
people
who
can
sneak
up
on
me
but
you
figured
I'd
come
after
after
whatever
tortures
fury
can
concoct
you
would
appear
as
a
friend
as
a
bomb
and
I
would
cooperate
I
want
to
know
what
you've
done
to
agent
Barton
I'd
say
I've
expanded
his
mind
once
you've
won
once
you're
king
of
the
mountain
what
happens
to
his
mind
there's
this
love
agent
Romanoff
love
is
for
children
I
owe
him
the
death
tell
me
before
I
worked
for
shield
I
well
I
made
a
name
for
myself
I
have
a
very
specific
skill
set
I
didn't
care
who
I
used
it
for
or
on
I
got
on
shields
radar
in
a
bad
way
hatred
Barton
was
sent
to
kill
me
he
made
a
different
call
and
what
will
you
do
if
I
vow
to
spare
him
not
let
you
out
on
that
but
I
like
this
your
world
in
the
balance
and
you
bargain
for
one
man
regime
is
fall
every
day
I
tend
not
to
weep
over
that
I'm
Russian
where
I
was
I
will
tell
you
now
it's
really
not
that
complicated
I
got
red
in
my
ledger
I'd
like
to
wipe
it
out
can
you
can
you
wipe
out
that
much
red
drei
coughs
daughter
Sao
Paolo
the
hospital
fire
Barton
told
me
everything
the
ledger
is
dripping
it's
gushing
red
and
you
think
saving
a
man
no
more
virtuous
than
yourself
will
change
anything
this
is
the
basest
sentimentality
this
is
a
child
prayer
pathetic
you
lie
and
kill
in
the
service
of
liars
and
killers
you
pretend
to
be
separate
to
have
your
own
code
something
that
makes
up
for
the
horrors
but
they
are
part
of
you
and
they
will
never
go
away
I
won't
touch
Barton
not
until
I
make
him
kill
you
slowly
intimately
in
every
way
he
knows
you
fear
and
then
her
wake
just
long
enough
to
see
his
good
work
and
when
he
screams
our
split
his
skull
this
is
my
bargain
you
mewling
quim
your
monster
you
hold
the
monster
so
banner
that's
your
play
what
Loki
means
to
unleash
the
Hulk
keep
banner
in
the
lab
I'm
on
my
way
son
Thor
is
awful
thank
you
for
your
cooperation
