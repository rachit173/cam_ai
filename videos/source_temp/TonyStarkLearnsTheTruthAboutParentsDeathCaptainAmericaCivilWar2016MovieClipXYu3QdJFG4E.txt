If
it's
any
comfort,
they
died
in
their
sleep.
Did
you
really
think
I
wanted
more
of
you?
What
the
hell?
I'm
grateful
to
them,
though.
They
brought
you
here.
Please,
Captain.
The
Soviets
built
this
chamber
to
withstand
the
launch
blast
of
UR-100
rockets.
I'm
betting
I
could
beat
that.
Oh,
I'm
sure
you
could,
Mr
Stark.
Given
time.
But
then
you'd
never
know
why
you
came.
You
killed
innocent
people
in
Vienna
just
to
bring
us
here?
I've
thought
about
nothing
else
for
over
a
year.
I
studied
you.
I
followed
you.
But
now
that
you're
standing
here...
I
just
realised...
there's
a
bit
of
green
in
the
blue
of
your
eyes.
How
nice
to
find
a
flaw.
You're
Sokovian.
Is
that
what
this
is
about?
Sokovia
was
a
failed
state
long
before
you
blew
it
to
hell.
No.
I'm
here
because
I
made
a
promise.
You
lost
someone?
I
lost
everyone.
And
so
will
you.
An
empire
toppled
by
its
enemies
can
rise
again.
But
one
which
crumbles
from
within?
That's
dead.
Forever.
I
know
that
road.
What
is
this?
Help
my
wife.
Please.
Help.
Sergeant
Barnes?
Howard!
Howard!
No,
Tony.
Did
you
know?
I
didn't
know
it
was
him.
Don't
bullshit
me,
Rogers.
Did
you
know?
Yes.
