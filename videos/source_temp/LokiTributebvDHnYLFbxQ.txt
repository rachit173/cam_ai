doesn't
have
to
get
any
message
of
course
it
does
I've
come
too
far
for
anything
else
I
am
Loki
of
Asgard
and
I
am
burdened
with
glorious
purpose
Loki
brother
a
sword
we
have
no
qualms
with
an
ant
has
no
quarrel
with
a
boot
you
planning
to
step
on
us
I
come
with
glad
tidings
of
a
world
made
free
free
from
what
freedom
freedom
is
life's
great
lie
once
you
accept
that
your
heart
[Music]
is
not
this
simpler
is
this
not
your
natural
state
if
the
unspoken
truth
of
humanity
lets
you
crave
subjugation
the
bright
lure
of
freedom
diminishes
your
life's
joy
in
a
mad
scramble
for
power
her
identity
you
were
made
to
be
ruled
in
the
end
you
were
always
it's
an
impressive
case
not
built
I
think
for
me
look
for
something
a
lot
stronger
then
you
know
I've
heard
-
beast
man
how
desperate
are
you
you
call
on
such
lost
creatures
to
defend
you
how
desperate
am
i
you
threaten
my
world
with
war
you
steal
a
force
you
can't
hope
to
control
you
talk
about
peace
and
you
kill
cause
it's
fun
you
have
made
me
very
desperate
you
might
not
be
glad
that
you
did
to
have
the
tesseract
to
have
power
unlimited
and
then
to
be
reminded
what
real
power
is
