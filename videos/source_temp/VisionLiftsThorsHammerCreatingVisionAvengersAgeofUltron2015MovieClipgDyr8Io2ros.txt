I'm
sorry
that
was
odd
Thank
You
Thor
you
helped
create
this
I've
had
a
vision
a
whirlpool
that
sucks
in
all
hope
of
life
and
how
did
Santa
is
that
what
did
yep
the
mind
stone
it's
one
of
the
six
Infinity
stones
the
greatest
power
in
the
universe
unparalleled
in
its
destructive
capabilities
then
why
would
you
bring
stock
is
right
oh
it's
definitely
the
end
times
The
Avengers
cannot
defeat
Ultron
not
alone
why
does
your
vision
sound
like
Jarvis
we
reconfigured
Jarvis's
matrix
to
create
something
new
I
think
I've
had
my
fill
of
new
you
think
I'm
a
child
of
Ultron
you're
not
I'm
not
altering
I'm
not
Java
silent
I
am
I
looked
in
your
head
and
saw
annihilation
look
again
her
silver
approval
means
Jack
to
me
their
powers
the
horrors
in
our
heads
Ultron
himself
they
all
came
from
the
mind
stone
and
nothing
compared
to
what
it
can
unleash
the
with
it
on
our
Tsar
is
it
are
you
on
our
side
I
don't
think
it's
that
simple
well
better
get
real
simple
real
soon
I
am
on
the
side
of
life
Ultron
isn't
he
will
end
it
all
what's
he
waiting
for
you
where
sokovia
he's
gotten
out
there
too
if
we're
wrong
about
you
if
you're
the
monster
that
Ultron
major
to
be
what
what
do
you
do
I
don't
want
to
kill
hadron
he's
unique
and
he's
in
pain
but
that
pain
will
roll
over
the
earth
so
he
must
be
destroyed
every
form
he's
built
every
trace
of
his
presence
on
the
net
we
have
to
act
now
and
not
one
of
us
can
do
it
without
the
others
maybe
I
am
a
monster
I
don't
think
I'd
know
if
I
were
one
and
not
what
you
are
and
not
what
you
intended
so
there
may
be
no
way
to
make
you
trust
me
but
we
need
to
go
right
well
done
three
minutes
yeah
what
you
need
you
