can't
see
in
those
okay
it's
just
that
when
whatever
happened
happened
it's
like
my
senses
have
been
dialed
to
there's
there's
way
too
much
input
so
they
use
kind
of
help
me
focus
you
in
dire
need
of
an
upgrade
systemic
top
to
bottom
point
restoration
that's
why
I'm
here
why
are
you
doing
this
I
gotta
know
what's
your
mo
what
gets
you
out
of
that
twin
bed
in
the
morning
because
because
I've
been
me
my
whole
life
and
I've
had
these
powers
for
six
months
I
read
books
I
build
computers
and
yeah
I
would
love
to
play
football
but
I
couldn't
then
so
I
shouldn't
matter
because
you're
different
exactly
but
I
can't
tell
anybody
that
so
I'm
not
look
when
you
can
do
the
things
that
I
can
but
you
don't
and
then
the
bad
things
happen
they
have
to
look
at
you
so
you
want
to
look
after
the
little
guy
you
want
to
do
your
part
make
the
world
a
better
place
on
that
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
just
looking
up
a
little
I'm
gonna
sit
here
so
you
move
the
leg
jump

sport

don't
I
don't
even
have
a
driver
been
to
Germany
No

love
it
I
can't
go
to
Germany
why
pretend
you
didn't
say
that
I'm
being
serious
I
can't
just
drop
out
of
smoke
a
little
dangerous
so
haughty
I'm
taking
this
trip
