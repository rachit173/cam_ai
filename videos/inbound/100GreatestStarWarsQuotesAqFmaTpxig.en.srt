1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:23,840
I have a bad feeling about this there's

2
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:30,710
always a bigger fish does not make you

3
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:34,429
intelligent pilot my life your slave I'm

4
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:39,140
a person my name is Anakin no one can

5
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,820
tell a Jedi I wish that were so mom you

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,090
say the biggest problem in this universe

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,110
is nobody helps you each other may the

8
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,630
force be with you

9
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:51,169

10
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:54,789
concentrate on the moment feel don't

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,710
think new is the path to the dark side

12
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:02,419
fear leads to anger anger leads to hate

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:05,450
hate leads to suffering your focus

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,710
determines your reality agree with you

15
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:14,949
the council does your apprentice

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:21,170
Skywalker will be always true there are

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:24,530
no more no less a master and an

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:29,990
apprentice the dark side clouds

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:32,540
everything impossible to see the future

20
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,610
base why do I get the feeling you're

21
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,040
going to be the death of me don't say

22
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:42,300
that master you're the closest thing I

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,420
have to a father attachments for me

24
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,469
possession is forbidden compassion which

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,870
I would define as unconditional love

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:02:10,320
central to a Jedi's life lost a planet

27
00:01:51,869 --> 00:02:16,049
master obi-wan has young Skywalker

28
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:22,679
hey you're not all-powerful well I

29
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:26,549
should be some day I will be I will be

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,130
the most powerful Jedi ever it's all

31
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,739
though be ones foe

32
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:39,990
he's jealous he's holding me back

33
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:42,739
I killed them I killed them all and not

34
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,739
just the men

35
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,050
but the women and the children too

36
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,779
they're like animals and I slaughtered

37
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,920
them like animals the Shroud of the dark

38
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,200
side has fallen

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:04,630
begun the clone war has

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,430
I've got a bad feeling about this my

41
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,490
powers have doubled since the last time

42
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:14,070
we met count good twice the pride double

43
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:16,659
the fall death is a natural part of life

44
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,959
rejoice for those around you who

45
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:24,130
transform into the force mourn them do

46
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:28,889
not miss them do not attachment leads to

47
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:32,380
jealousy the shadow of greed that is

48
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,740
dark side of the force is a pathway to

49
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,940
many abilities some consider to be

50
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:42,239
unnatural is it possible to learn this

51
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,240
power

52
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,450
not from a Jedi obi-wan may the force be

53
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,180
with you

54
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,000
goodbye old friend may the force be with

55
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,130

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,130
Power greater than any Jedi

57
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:12,890
I pledged myself to your teachings

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:30,560

60
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,850

61
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,850

62
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:51,150

00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:03,629
you were the chosen one it was said that

66
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,360
you would destroy the Sith not join them

67
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:11,789
bring balance to the force not leaving a

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,790
darkness you were my brother Anakin

69
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:27,150

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:27,150
Loreena can you hear me yes master

71
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:43,270
you are part of the Rebel Alliance and a

72
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:46,720
traitor taken away just you reconsider

73
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,780
playing that message for him no I don't

think he likes you at all no I don't

75
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,430
like you either

76
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,800
for over a thousand generations the Jedi

77
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,280
Knights from the guardians of peace of

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,330
justice in the Old Republic before the

79
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,090
dark times before the Empire a young

80
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,270
Jedi named Darth Vader who was a pupil

81
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,430
of mine until he turned to evil helped

82
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:16,180
the Empire hunt down and destroy the

83
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,640
Jedi Knights he betrayed and murdered

84
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,950
your father

85
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,140
Vader was seduced by the dark side of

86
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,650
the force the force is what gives a Jedi

87
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,230
his path it's an energy field created by

88
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,450
all living things it surrounds us and

89
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,060
penetrates us it binds the Galaxy

90
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,910
together don't be too proud of this

91
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,680
technological terror you've constructed

92
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,230
the ability to destroy a planet is

93
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,700
insignificant next to the power of the

94
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,130
force I find your lack of faith

95
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:53,860
disturbing these aren't the droids

96
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:56,140
you're looking for the great disturbance

97
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,750
in the force as if millions of voices

98
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,630
suddenly cried out in terror and were

99
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,710
suddenly silenced I fear something

100
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,050
terrible has happened

101
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,520
hokey religions and ancient weapons are

102
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,490
no match for a good blaster at your side

103
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,640
kid

104
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,750
very bad feeling about lose them all

105
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,059
foolish fool or the fool who follows it

106
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:21,890
too short for a stormtrooper huh

107
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:30,410
Oh uniform I'm Luke Skywalker I'm here

108
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:33,349
to rescue you we meet again at last the

109
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,250
circle is now complete when I left you I

110
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:39,139
was but to learn now I am the master the

111
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,440
amount of evilness

112
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,749
you can't wind us if you strike me down

113
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,750
I shall become more powerful than you

114
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:53,500
can possibly imagine

115
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:56,420
hey Luke may the force be with you

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,660
evacuate in our moment of triumph I

117
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,849

124
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:34,520
a Jedi Adventure Jedi craves not these

125
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:43,509
things you are reckless

126
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:43,509

training with our combined strength we

146
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,320
can end this destructive conflict and

147
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:27,430
bring order to the galaxy if you only

148
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,040
knew the power of the dark side obi-wan

149
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:34,290
never told you what happens in your

150
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,290
father he told me enough

151
00:10:37,010 --> 00:11:03,710
I strongly Meyer with the force what we

152
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:08,600
start down the dark path forever will it

153
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:11,840
dominate your destiny your father was

154
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,360
seduced by the dark side of the force he

155
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,540
ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became

156
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,320
Darth Vader when that happened the good

157
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:25,730
man who was your father was destroyed

158
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:32,270
lai lai is my sister the emperor has

159
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:35,330
been expecting you I know father so you

160
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,710
have accepted the truth I've accepted

161
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,740
the truth that you were once Anakin

162
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:43,700
Skywalker my father that name no longer

163
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:48,770
has any meaning for me you don't know

164
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:52,040
the power of the dark side I must obey

165
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:54,860
my master it's a drama your

166
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,540
overconfidence is your weakness your

167
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:03,650
faith in your friends is yours

168
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:06,470
I'm afraid the deflector shield will be

169
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:08,830
quite operational when your friends

170
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,990
arrive

171
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:17,120

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:19,480
yourself more my servant you like your

side it is the only way you can save

178
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:54,360
your friends your feelings for them are

179
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:58,500
strong especially for sister if you will

180
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:02,520
not turn to the dark side then perhaps

181
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:07,260
