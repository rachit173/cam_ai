what have I to fear the Avengers that's

16
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:01,899

tix as well to get any traction I'll

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,320
give you that one but let's do a head

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,930
count here

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,880
your brother the demigod a super soldier

24
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,910
living legend who kind of lives up to

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,590
the legend a man with breathtaking

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,220
anger-management issues a couple of

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,870
Master assassins and you big fella

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,910
you've managed to piss off every single

29
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:35,100
one of them that was the plan

30
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:38,820
not a great plan when they come

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,550
and they will I'll come for you I have

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,200
an army we have a Hulk well I thought

33
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,330
the Beast had one at all you're missing

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,340
the point there's no throne there is no

35
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,700
version of this where you come out on

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,240
top maybe your army comes and maybe it's

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,560
too much for us but it's all on you if

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,760

how would your friends have time for me

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:15,260

42
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:21,690
usually works well performance issues

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:28,670
not uncommon one out of five Jarvis and

44
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:31,670

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,670
