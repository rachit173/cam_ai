I'll
feel
you
cold
sir
afraid
are
you
no
sir
see
through
you
we
can
be
mindful
of
your
feelings
your
thoughts
dwell
on
your
mother
I
miss
her
hmm
afraid
to
lose
her
I
think
hmm
what
does
that
got
to
do
with
anything
everything
flu
is
the
path
to
the
dark
side
fear
leads
to
anger
anger
leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
suffering
has
sense
much
fear
in
you
