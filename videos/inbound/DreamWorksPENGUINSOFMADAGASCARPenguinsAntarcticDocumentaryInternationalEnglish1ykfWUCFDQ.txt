tumbling
onto
their
chubby
bonbons

could
take
these
risks
to
little
snow
clowns

anyone
even
know
where
we're

tundra

me
a

ASAP
all
one
would
have
to
do
is
collect
feet
of
kelp
dried
in
a
tiny
and
helpless
the
baby
penguins
are
frozen
with
fear
they
know
if
they
fall
from
this
cliff
they
will
surely
die
Gupta
give
him
a
shot
harnessing
the
jellyfish
we've
trained
to
obey
simple
voice
commands

works
do
we
see
the
white
of
it
sighs
rustling
Gimpo
very
little
white
almost

bad
moment
but

beauty
exact
in
my
mouth
hello
are
you
my
family
you
don't
have
a
family
and
we're
all
going
to
die
what-mon
I
thought
that
was
what
we
were
all
nothing
about

gonna
die

know
what
is
what's
our
trajectory
percent
certain
we're
still
doomed
and
the
other
5%
adventuring
glory
like
no
Penguins

ever
seen
before

untold
