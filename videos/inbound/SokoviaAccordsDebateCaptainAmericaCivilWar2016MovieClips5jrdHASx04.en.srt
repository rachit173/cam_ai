1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,880
of Honor which is one more than you have

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,140
so let's say we agree to this thing

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,579
how long is it going to be before they

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,510
LoJack us like a bunch of common

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,620
criminal 117 countries want to sign this

7
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:14,939
117 Sam and you're just like now it's

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,610
cool which I'm longer you're gonna play

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,100
both I have an equation oh now this will

10
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,079
clear it up in the eight years since

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,930
mrs. Stark announced himself as iron man

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,110
the number of known enhanced persons has

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,970
grown exponentially and during the same

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,829
period the number of potentially

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,930
world-ending events has risen at a

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:39,150
commensurate rate these things our fault

17
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,700
I'm saying there may be a causality our

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:47,059
very strength invites challenged

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,060
challenged incites conflict conflict

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,180
breeds catastrophe oversight

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,010
oversight is not an idea that can be

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,310
dismissed out of hand boom

23
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,930
Tony you're being uncharacteristically

24
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:07,189
non hyper-verbal because he's already

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,330
made up his mind oh you know me so long

26
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:12,090
actually I'm nursing an electromagnetic

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,930
headache that's what's going on cabs

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,000
just pain discomfort

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,550
who's putting coffee grounds in the

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,360
disposal my rent a bed and breakfast for

31
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:29,899
the biker gang

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:32,580
oh that's Charles Spencer by the way

33
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:36,449
it's a great kid computer engineering

34
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,640
degree 3.6 GPA at a floor-level gig and

35
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,170
intel plan for the fall but first i'm

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,510
going to put some miles on his soul

37
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,050
before he parked it behind a desk see

38
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,889
the world maybe be of service

39
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,299
Charlie don't want to go to Vegas for

40
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,670
Fort Lauderdale which is what I would do

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,619
we didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam

42
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,900
sounds fun he decided to spend his

43
00:01:52,619 --> 00:02:01,109
summer building sustainable housing for

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,399
the poor des with sokovia he want to

45
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,840
make a difference I suppose I mean we

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,979
won't know because we drop it building

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,980
on them while we were kicking ass

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,440
there's no decision-making process here

49
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,660
we need to be put in check whatever form

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,220
that takes I'm game if we can't accept

51
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,110
limitations we're bound realist for no

52
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,690
better than the bad guys

53
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,890
Sony someone dies on your watch you

54
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,870
don't keep up who said we're giving up

55
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,500
we offer not taking responsibility for

56
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,510
our actions

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,840
this document just shifts the blind

58
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,910
sorry Steve that that is dangerously

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,860
arrogant this is the United Nations

60
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,780
we're talking about it's not the world

61
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,190
Security Council it's not shield it's

62
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,350
not hide milk but it's run by people

63
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,720
with agendas and agendas change that's

64
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,130
good that's why I'm here when I realized

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,170
what my weapons were capable of in the

66
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,470
wrong hands I shut it down stop

67
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,060
manufacturing you chose to do that if we

68
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,210
sign this we surrender our right to

69
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,680
choose what if this panel sends us some

70
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,359
what we don't think we should do what if

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,850
there somewhere we need to go and they

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,740
don't let us we may not be perfect to

73
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,950
save his hands are still our own if we

74
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,440
don't do this now it's gonna be done to

75
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,540
us later that's the fact that won't be

76
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,880
pretty saying they'll come for me we

77
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:23,260
would protect you maybe Tony's right if

78
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,170
we have one hand on the wheel we can

79
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,610
