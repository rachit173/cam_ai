I
have
a
bad
feeling
about
this
there's
always
a
bigger
fish
does
not
make
you
intelligent
pilot
my
life
your
slave
I'm
a
person
my
name
is
Anakin
no
one
can
tell
a
Jedi
I
wish
that
were
so
mom
you
say
the
biggest
problem
in
this
universe
is
nobody
helps
you
each
other
may
the
force
be
with
you
he
was
your
instincts
remember
concentrate
on
the
moment
feel
don't
think
new
is
the
path
to
the
dark
side
fear
leads
to
anger
anger
leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
suffering
your
focus
determines
your
reality
agree
with
you
the
council
does
your
apprentice
Skywalker
will
be
always
true
there
are
no
more
no
less
a
master
and
an
apprentice
the
dark
side
clouds
everything
impossible
to
see
the
future
base
why
do
I
get
the
feeling
you're
going
to
be
the
death
of
me
don't
say
that
master
you're
the
closest
thing
I
have
to
a
father
attachments
for
me
possession
is
forbidden
compassion
which
I
would
define
as
unconditional
love
central
to
a
Jedi's
life
lost
a
planet
master
obi-wan
has
young
Skywalker
hey
you're
not
all-powerful
well
I
should
be
some
day
I
will
be
I
will
be
the
most
powerful
Jedi
ever
it's
all
though
be
ones
foe
he's
jealous
he's
holding
me
back
I
killed
them
I
killed
them
all
and
not
just
the
men
but
the
women
and
the
children
too
they're
like
animals
and
I
slaughtered
them
like
animals
the
Shroud
of
the
dark
side
has
fallen
begun
the
clone
war
has
I've
got
a
bad
feeling
about
this
my
powers
have
doubled
since
the
last
time
we
met
count
good
twice
the
pride
double
the
fall
death
is
a
natural
part
of
life
rejoice
for
those
around
you
who
transform
into
the
force
mourn
them
do
not
miss
them
do
not
attachment
leads
to
jealousy
the
shadow
of
greed
that
is
dark
side
of
the
force
is
a
pathway
to
many
abilities
some
consider
to
be
unnatural
is
it
possible
to
learn
this
power
not
from
a
Jedi
obi-wan
may
the
force
be
with
you
goodbye
old
friend
may
the
force
be
with
the
only
through
me
can
you
achieve
a
Power
greater
than
any
Jedi
I
pledged
myself
to
your
teachings
henceforth
you
shall
be
known
as
da
Veda
the
time
has
come
execute
order
Master
Skywalker
there
are
too
many
of
them
what
are
we
going
to
do
so
this
is
how
Liberty
dies
it's
under
supplies
I
have
brought
peace
freedom
justice
and
security
to
my
new
empire
you
were
the
chosen
one
it
was
said
that
you
would
destroy
the
Sith
not
join
them
bring
balance
to
the
force
not
leaving
a
darkness
you
were
my
brother
Anakin
I
loved
you
Loreena
can
you
hear
me
yes
master
you
are
part
of
the
Rebel
Alliance
and
a
traitor
taken
away
just
you
reconsider
playing
that
message
for
him
no
I
don't
think
he
likes
you
at
all
no
I
don't
like
you
either
for
over
a
thousand
generations
the
Jedi
Knights
from
the
guardians
of
peace
of
justice
in
the
Old
Republic
before
the
dark
times
before
the
Empire
a
young
Jedi
named
Darth
Vader
who
was
a
pupil
of
mine
until
he
turned
to
evil
helped
the
Empire
hunt
down
and
destroy
the
Jedi
Knights
he
betrayed
and
murdered
your
father
Vader
was
seduced
by
the
dark
side
of
the
force
the
force
is
what
gives
a
Jedi
his
path
it's
an
energy
field
created
by
all
living
things
it
surrounds
us
and
penetrates
us
it
binds
the
Galaxy
together
don't
be
too
proud
of
this
technological
terror
you've
constructed
the
ability
to
destroy
a
planet
is
insignificant
next
to
the
power
of
the
force
I
find
your
lack
of
faith
disturbing
these
aren't
the
droids
you're
looking
for
the
great
disturbance
in
the
force
as
if
millions
of
voices
suddenly
cried
out
in
terror
and
were
suddenly
silenced
I
fear
something
terrible
has
happened
hokey
religions
and
ancient
weapons
are
no
match
for
a
good
blaster
at
your
side
kid
very
bad
feeling
about
lose
them
all
foolish
fool
or
the
fool
who
follows
it
too
short
for
a
stormtrooper
huh
Oh
uniform
I'm
Luke
Skywalker
I'm
here
to
rescue
you
we
meet
again
at
last
the
circle
is
now
complete
when
I
left
you
I
was
but
to
learn
now
I
am
the
master
the
amount
of
evilness
you
can't
wind
us
if
you
strike
me
down
I
shall
become
more
powerful
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
hey
Luke
may
the
force
be
with
you
evacuate
in
our
moment
of
triumph
I
think
you
overestimate
their
chances
use
the
Force
I
thought
they
smelled
bad
on
the
outside
why
you
stuck-up
half-witted
scruffy-looking
nerf-herder
who's
scruffy-looking
the
force
is
strong
with
him
the
son
of
Skywalker
must
not
become
a
Jedi
Adventure
Jedi
craves
not
these
things
you
are
reckless
I'm
not
afraid
you
will
be
you
will
be
I
feel
cold
be
strong
the
dark
side
of
the
force
a
domain
of
evil
it
is
and
you
must
go
now
no
different
only
different
in
your
mind
you
must
unlearn
what
you
have
feared
-
I'll
do
not
there
is
no
try
sighs
messagenet
look
at
me
that's
me
by
my
size
do
you
hmm
and
where
you
should
not
for
my
Ally
is
the
force
and
Nepal
for
kite
ISM
is
why
you
fail
apology
accepted
captain
needa
that
boy
is
our
last
hope
no
there
is
a
gardener
I
love
you
I
know
the
force
is
with
you
young
Skywalker
but
you
are
not
a
Jedi
yet
now
release
your
anger
only
your
hatred
can
destroy
me
oh
don't
make
me
destroy
you
join
me
and
I
will
complete
your
training
with
our
combined
strength
we
can
end
this
destructive
conflict
and
bring
order
to
the
galaxy
if
you
only
knew
the
power
of
the
dark
side
obi-wan
never
told
you
what
happens
in
your
father
he
told
me
enough
I
strongly
Meyer
with
the
force
what
we
start
down
the
dark
path
forever
will
it
dominate
your
destiny
your
father
was
seduced
by
the
dark
side
of
the
force
he
ceased
to
be
Anakin
Skywalker
and
became
Darth
Vader
when
that
happened
the
good
man
who
was
your
father
was
destroyed
lai
lai
is
my
sister
the
emperor
has
been
expecting
you
I
know
father
so
you
have
accepted
the
truth
I've
accepted
the
truth
that
you
were
once
Anakin
Skywalker
my
father
that
name
no
longer
has
any
meaning
for
me
you
don't
know
the
power
of
the
dark
side
I
must
obey
my
master
it's
a
drama
your
overconfidence
is
your
weakness
your
faith
in
your
friends
is
yours
I'm
afraid
the
deflector
shield
will
be
quite
operational
when
your
friends
arrive
with
each
passing
moment
you
make
yourself
more
my
servant
you
like
your
father
for
you
that's
betrayal
father
I
feel
the
good
in
you
a
conflict
there
is
no
conflict
and
give
yourself
to
the
dark
side
it
is
the
only
way
you
can
save
your
friends
your
feelings
for
them
are
strong
especially
for
sister
if
you
will
not
turn
to
the
dark
side
then
perhaps
she
will
never
turn
to
the
dark
side
you
failed
your
highness
I
am
a
Jedi
like
my
father
before
me
so
be
it
Jedi
Luke
help
me
take
this
mask
off
I'll
not
leave
you
here
I've
got
to
save
you
already
