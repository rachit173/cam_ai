hey
Master
Shifu
where
we
got
pirates
vandals
of
volcano
Mountain
whatever
it
is
I
will
take
them
down
cuz
I
am
in
a
mood
I
need
to
get
something
done
you
know
what
I
mean
uh
what
are
you
doing
one
of
that's
true
ways
final
teachings
Wow
awesome
how
did
you
do
that
inner
peace
inner
peace
that's
cool
inner
peace
of
what
it
is
the
next
phase
of
your
training
every
master
must
find
his
path
to
inner
peace
some
choose
to
meditate
for
years
in
a
cave
just
like
this
without
the
slightest
taste
of
food
or
water
or
some
find
it
through
pain
and
suffering
as
I
did
both
the
day
you
were
chosen
as
Dragon
Warrior
was
the
worst
day
of
my
life
by
far
nothing
else
came
close
it
was
the
worst
most
painful
mind
destroying
horrible
moment
okay
I
have
ever
experienced
but
once
I
realized
the
problem
was
not
you
but
within
me
I
found
inner
peace
and
was
able
to
harness
the
flow
of
the
universe
so
that's
it
I
just
need
inner
peace
my
innards
are
already
super
super
peaceful
so
all
I
need
to
do
is
just
get
this
thing
going
inner
peace
you're
going
down
now
show
me
what
you
were
doing
there
with
your
feet
