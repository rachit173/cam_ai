a
Jedi
uses
the
force
for
knowledge
and
defense
never
attack
but
tell
me
why
I
kill
no
there
is
no
way
nothing
more
will
I
teach
you
today
clear
your
mind
of
question
go
with
the
Queen
to
Naboo
and
discover
the
identity
of
this
dark
warrior
this
is
the
clue
we
need
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
synth
may
the
force
be
with
you
[Music]
then
I
am
a
Jedi
not
yet
one
thing
remains
Vader
you
must
confront
Vader
death
is
a
natural
part
of
life
rejoice
for
those
around
you
who
transform
into
the
force
mourn
them
do
not
miss
them
do
not
train
yourself
to
let
go
of
everything
you
fear
to
lose
fear
is
the
path
to
the
dark
side
fear
leads
to
anger
anger
leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
suffering
[Music]
I
sense
much
fear
in
you
master
moving
stones
around
is
one
thing
this
is
totally
different
no
no
different
only
different
in
your
mind
you
must
unlearn
what
you
have
Pierre
all
right
I'll
give
it
a
try
no
final
do
[Music]
around
the
survivors
a
perimeter
create
it's
too
big
tires
make
a
net
look
at
me
that'd
be
my
size
do
you
hmm
and
where
you
should
not
for
my
Ally
is
the
force
and
the
powerful
kite
is
anger
fear
pleasure
the
dark
side
what
you
start
down
the
dark
path
forever
will
it
dominate
your
destiny
the
boy
you
trained
ganya
is
consumed
by
Darth
Vader
but
do
not
know
where
the
emperor
has
sent
him
use
your
feelings
obi-wan
and
find
him
you
will
you
