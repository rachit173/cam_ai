1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,020
if you only knew the power of the dark

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:12,660
side obi-wan never told you what

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:20,160
happened the father he told me he told

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:25,290
me you killed no I am the father the son

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,660
of Skywalker must not become a Jedi if

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:32,519
he could be turned he would become a

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:36,300
powerful ally getting me done he will

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,090
join us or die Master

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,450
this station is now the ultimate power

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,490
in the universe I suggest we use it

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,760
don't be too proud of this technological

12
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,669
terror you've constructed the ability to

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,060
destroy a planet is insignificant next

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:59,160
to the power of the force you don't know

15
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:03,749
the power of the dark side I must obey

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,830
my master I will not turn and you'll be

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,400
forced to kill me

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,410
if that is your destiny your sad

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,850
devotion to that ancient religion has

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,090
not helped you conjure up the stolen

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:22,530
data tapes or given you clairvoyance

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:26,460
enough to find the rebels hidden fort I

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,460
find your lack of faith disturbing

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:48,770
you are unwise to know your defenses you

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,210
have failed me for the last time captain

26
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,790

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,070
make ready to land our troops beyond

28
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,470
their energy field and deploy the feet

29
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,770
so the nothing gets off the system you

30
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:04,510
are in the math now Admiral yet I can

31
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:08,200

32
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,200
we meet again at last the circle is

33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,830
nothing when I left you I was but to

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,790
learn now I am the master only a master

35
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,790
of evil nada

36
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,250

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:34,030
