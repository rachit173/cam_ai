so
the
mark
is
not
ready
for
deployment
then
skip
the
spinning
rims
were
on
the
clock
please
tell
me
you're
going
to
appeal
to
my
humanity
actually
I'm
planning
to
threaten
you
you
should
have
left
your
honor
on
for
that
ya
seen
a
bit
of
mileage
and
you've
got
the
little
stick
of
destiny
you
like
a
drink
extolling
me
right
change
anything
no
no
threatening
no
drink
you
sure
I'm
having
one
that's
atari
a--
coming
nothing
will
change
that
what
have
I
to
fear
the
Avengers
that's
what
we
call
ourselves
sort
of
like
a
team
Earth's
Mightiest
Heroes
timeframe
yes
I've
met
them
yeah
tix
as
well
to
get
any
traction
I'll
give
you
that
one
but
let's
do
a
head
count
here
your
brother
the
demigod
a
super
soldier
living
legend
who
kind
of
lives
up
to
the
legend
a
man
with
breathtaking
anger-management
issues
a
couple
of
Master
assassins
and
you
big
fella
you've
managed
to
piss
off
every
single
one
of
them
that
was
the
plan
not
a
great
plan
when
they
come
and
they
will
I'll
come
for
you
I
have
an
army
we
have
a
Hulk
well
I
thought
the
Beast
had
one
at
all
you're
missing
the
point
there's
no
throne
there
is
no
version
of
this
where
you
come
out
on
top
maybe
your
army
comes
and
maybe
it's
too
much
for
us
but
it's
all
on
you
if
we
can't
protect
the
air
if
you
can
be
damn
well
sure
we'll
avenge
it
how
would
your
friends
have
time
for
me
when
they're
so
busy
fighting
you
it's
usually
works
well
performance
issues
not
uncommon
one
out
of
five
Jarvis
and
it
turned
out
you
all
fall
before
me
boy
yeah
you
and
there's
one
other
person
you
pissed
off
his
name
is
Phil
