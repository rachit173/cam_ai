secretary
Ross
has
a
Congressional
Medal
of
Honor
which
is
one
more
than
you
have
so
let's
say
we
agree
to
this
thing
how
long
is
it
going
to
be
before
they
LoJack
us
like
a
bunch
of
common
criminal
countries
want
to
sign
this
Sam
and
you're
just
like
now
it's
cool
which
I'm
longer
you're
gonna
play
both
I
have
an
equation
oh
now
this
will
clear
it
up
in
the
eight
years
since
mrs.
Stark
announced
himself
as
iron
man
the
number
of
known
enhanced
persons
has
grown
exponentially
and
during
the
same
period
the
number
of
potentially
world-ending
events
has
risen
at
a
commensurate
rate
these
things
our
fault
I'm
saying
there
may
be
a
causality
our
very
strength
invites
challenged
challenged
incites
conflict
conflict
breeds
catastrophe
oversight
oversight
is
not
an
idea
that
can
be
dismissed
out
of
hand
boom
Tony
you're
being
uncharacteristically
non
hyper-verbal
because
he's
already
made
up
his
mind
oh
you
know
me
so
long
actually
I'm
nursing
an
electromagnetic
headache
that's
what's
going
on
cabs
just
pain
discomfort
who's
putting
coffee
grounds
in
the
disposal
my
rent
a
bed
and
breakfast
for
the
biker
gang
oh
that's
Charles
Spencer
by
the
way
it's
a
great
kid
computer
engineering
degree
3.6
GPA
at
a
floor-level
gig
and
intel
plan
for
the
fall
but
first
i'm
going
to
put
some
miles
on
his
soul
before
he
parked
it
behind
a
desk
see
the
world
maybe
be
of
service
Charlie
don't
want
to
go
to
Vegas
for
Fort
Lauderdale
which
is
what
I
would
do
we
didn't
go
to
Paris
or
Amsterdam
sounds
fun
he
decided
to
spend
his
summer
building
sustainable
housing
for
the
poor
des
with
sokovia
he
want
to
make
a
difference
I
suppose
I
mean
we
won't
know
because
we
drop
it
building
on
them
while
we
were
kicking
ass
there's
no
decision-making
process
here
we
need
to
be
put
in
check
whatever
form
that
takes
I'm
game
if
we
can't
accept
limitations
we're
bound
realist
for
no
better
than
the
bad
guys
Sony
someone
dies
on
your
watch
you
don't
keep
up
who
said
we're
giving
up
we
offer
not
taking
responsibility
for
our
actions
this
document
just
shifts
the
blind
sorry
Steve
that
that
is
dangerously
arrogant
this
is
the
United
Nations
we're
talking
about
it's
not
the
world
Security
Council
it's
not
shield
it's
not
hide
milk
but
it's
run
by
people
with
agendas
and
agendas
change
that's
good
that's
why
I'm
here
when
I
realized
what
my
weapons
were
capable
of
in
the
wrong
hands
I
shut
it
down
stop
manufacturing
you
chose
to
do
that
if
we
sign
this
we
surrender
our
right
to
choose
what
if
this
panel
sends
us
some
what
we
don't
think
we
should
do
what
if
there
somewhere
we
need
to
go
and
they
don't
let
us
we
may
not
be
perfect
to
save
his
hands
are
still
our
own
if
we
don't
do
this
now
it's
gonna
be
done
to
us
later
that's
the
fact
that
won't
be
pretty
saying
they'll
come
for
me
we
would
protect
you
maybe
Tony's
right
if
we
have
one
hand
on
the
wheel
we
can
still
clear
taking
aren't
you
the
same
woman
who
told
the
government
to
kiss
her
ass
a
few
years
ago
I'm
just
reading
a
terrain
we
have
made
some
very
public
mistakes
we
need
to
win
their
trust
back
focus
up
I'm
sorry
did
I
just
miss
hear
you
or
did
you
agree
miss
uh
I
want
to
take
it
back
no
no
no
you
can't
retracted
thank
you
we
precedented
okay
case
closed
I
win
Aska
you
